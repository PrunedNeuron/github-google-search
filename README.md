# Github Search On Google
Adds a button to your Google searches to show only GitHub results. You can just click on the button and it will automatically add `site:github.com` to your search.

## Customizing the script
There are a couple things you can change inside the script:

* `useIcon` can be set to `false` if you don't want to see an icon inside the Reddit button. By default it's set to `true`
* `appendRight` can be set to `true` if you want to append the Reddit button to the right of Google's buttons (next to 'Tools'). By default it's set to `false`, which appends it next to the usual buttons like 'Videos'.
